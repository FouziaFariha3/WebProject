# WebProject
The project is a basic web-based calculator to add, divide, multiplicate and divide numbers. HTML, CSS, JavaScript, VS Code and Web Browser are used here. I created three files, wrote the calculator layout in HTML, styled calculator with CSS Grid, imposed logic in JS. Key feature is live display update and ensuring buttons execution was difficult.
